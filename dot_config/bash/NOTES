All interactive shells source /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc, while
interactive login shells also source /etc/profile and ~/.bash_profile.

Invoked as an interactive login shell, or with --login
When Bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive
shell with the --login option, it first reads and executes commands from the
file /etc/profile, if that file exists. After reading that file, it looks for
~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile, in that order, and reads and
executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable. The
--noprofile option may be used when the shell is started to inhibit this
behavior.
When an interactive login shell exits, or a non-interactive login shell
executes the exit builtin command, Bash reads and executes commands from the
file ~/.bash_logout, if it exists.

Invoked as an interactive non-login shell
When an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started, Bash reads and
executes commands from ~/.bashrc, if that file exists. This may be inhibited
by using the --norc option. The --rcfile file option will force Bash to read
and execute commands from file instead of ~/.bashrc.
So, typically, your ~/.bash_profile contains the line
if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then . ~/.bashrc; fi
after (or before) any login-specific initializations.
