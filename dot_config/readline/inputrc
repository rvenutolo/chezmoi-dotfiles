# When set to ‘on’, on operating systems that indicate they support it, Readline
# echoes a character corresponding to a signal generated from the keyboard. The
# default is ‘on’.
set echo-control-characters off

# If set to ‘on’, Readline performs filename matching and completion in a
# case-insensitive fashion. The default value is ‘off’.
set completion-ignore-case on

# If set to ‘on’, and completion-ignore-case is enabled, Readline treats hyphens
# (‘-’) and underscores (‘_’) as equivalent when performing case-insensitive
# filename matching and completion. The default value is ‘off’.
set completion-map-case on

# This alters the default behavior of the completion functions. If set to ‘on’,
# words which have more than one possible completion cause the matches to be
# listed immediately instead of ringing the bell. The default value is ‘off’.
set show-all-if-ambiguous on

# If set to ‘on’, completed names which are symbolic links to directories have a
# slash appended (subject to the value of mark-directories). The default is
# ‘off’.
set mark-symlinked-directories on

# This variable, when set to ‘on’, causes Readline to match files whose names
# begin with a ‘.’ (hidden files) when performing filename completion. If set to
# ‘off’, the leading ‘.’ must be supplied by the user in the filename to be
# completed. This variable is ‘on’ by default.
set match-hidden-files off

# If set to ‘on’, Readline uses an internal more-like pager to display a
# screenful of possible completions at a time. This variable is ‘on’ by default.
set page-completions off

# If set to ‘on’, a character denoting a file’s type is appended to the filename
# when listing possible completions. The default is ‘off’.
set visible-stats on

# If set to ‘on’, this alters the default completion behavior when inserting a
# single match into the line. It’s only active when performing completion in the
# middle of a word. If enabled, Readline does not insert characters from the
# completion that match characters after point in the word being completed, so
# portions of the word following the cursor are not duplicated. For instance, if
# this is enabled, attempting completion when the cursor is after the ‘e’ in
# ‘Makefile’ will result in ‘Makefile’ rather than ‘Makefilefile’, assuming
# there is a single possible completion. The default value is ‘off’.
set skip-completed-text on

# If set to ‘on’, when listing completions, Readline displays the common prefix
# of the set of possible completions using a different color. The color
# definitions are taken from the value of the LS_COLORS environment variable. If
# there is a color definition in LS_COLORS for the custom suffix
# ‘readline-colored-completion-prefix’, Readline uses this color for the common
# prefix instead of its default. The default is ‘off’.
set colored-completion-prefix on

# If set to ‘on’, Readline displays possible completions using different colors
# to indicate their file type. The color definitions are taken from the value of
# the LS_COLORS environment variable. The default is ‘off’.
set colored-stats on

# If set to ‘on’, Readline will enable eight-bit input (it will not clear the
# eighth bit in the characters it reads), regardless of what the terminal claims
# it can support. The default value is ‘off’, but Readline will set it to ‘on’
# if the locale contains eight-bit characters. The name meta-flag is a synonym
# for this variable. This variable is dependent on the LC_CTYPE locale category,
# and may change if the locale is changed.
set input-meta on

# If set to ‘on’, Readline will display characters with the eighth bit set
# directly rather than as a meta-prefixed escape sequence. The default is ‘off’,
# but Readline will set it to ‘on’ if the locale contains eight-bit characters.
# This variable is dependent on the LC_CTYPE locale category, and may change if
# the locale is changed.
set output-meta on

# If set to ‘on’, Readline will convert characters with the eighth bit set to an
# ASCII key sequence by stripping the eighth bit and prefixing an ESC character,
# converting them to a meta-prefixed key sequence. The default value is ‘on’,
# but will be set to ‘off’ if the locale is one that contains eight-bit
# characters. This variable is dependent on the LC_CTYPE locale category, and
# may change if the locale is changed.
set convert-meta off

# Use the text that has already been typed as the prefix for searching through
# commands (i.e. more intelligent Up/Down behavior)
"\e[B": history-search-forward
"\e[A": history-search-backward

# ensure that left and right continue to work correctly
"\e[C": forward-char
"\e[D": backward-char

# Use Alt/Meta + Delete to delete the preceding word
"\e[3;3~": kill-word

# Enable Alt-arrows
"\e[1;5D": backward-word ### Alt left
"\e[1;5C": forward-word ### Alt right

# Hop up directories
